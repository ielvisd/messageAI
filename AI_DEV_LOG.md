# AI Development Log: MessageAI 

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools 
**Tech Stack:** Quasar, Supabase
- **Claude Sonnet 4 (via Cursor)**: Creation of PRD, Tasks & Architecture diagrams. Primary development assistant for architecture, coding, complex logic, and debugging
- **MCP Servers**: Specialized documentation access for Quasar

## Workflow
Spent hours creating a new workflow based on testing every PR. This was a big lesson from last time where major features would break prior ones. I was trusting the AI too much. This helped me have more confidence and helped when debugging as I tested on the simulator. 

### üéØ Prompting Strategies That Worked Well

1. **Ask questions about edge cases** - Step through flows with the AI. It's very confident that something works when it doesn't and can make tests that just pass.

2. **Remind the AI to use MCPs** - Quasar has an MCP which is good for the AI to reference.

3. **Screenshots** - Very helpful for UI issues and design feedback.

4. **Provide logs and describe exact behavior** - Especially critical for mobile development. Copy-paste exact error messages and describe what you're seeing vs. what you expect.

## üí™ Strengths & Limitations

### Where AI Excelled
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Got features working quickly
- **Complex Integration** - Handled Quasar + Supabase setup well
- **Error Handling & Edge Cases** - Good at comprehensive error scenarios
- **Documentation & Comments** - Thorough inline documentation

### Where AI Struggled
- **Real-time Debugging** - Had to guide it heavily, copy-pasting logs and describing exact user experience vs. expectations
- **UX Clarity** - Created functional but unclear interfaces (e.g., multi-step forms without visual feedback for each step)
- **Integration Testing** - Auth flows and cross-feature testing still challenging
- **Aesthetic Design** - Results are functional but not beautiful

## üéì Key Learnings

### Critical Debugging Pattern
**Verbose console logging saved hours**. Adding `console.log` at key steps for the AI revealed the actual issue wasn't code logic but UX - users didn't realize they needed to click "+" to add members because there was no visual feedback. Spent hours debugging when the real fix was better UX indicators.

### Hardware Matters
Got an M4 Mac today - feels like I was coding with one hand tied behind my back before. AI tools run significantly faster with better hardware.

### Trust But Verify
Testing every PR is non-negotiable. AI will confidently say things work when they don't. Manual testing catches what automated tests miss, especially UX and integration issues.
