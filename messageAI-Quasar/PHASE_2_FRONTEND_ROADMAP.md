## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

### State Management
- Use existing `src/state/auth.ts` for user profile
- Create new state files:
  - `src/state/schedule.ts` - Multi-gym schedule state
  - `src/state/instructors.ts` - Instructor management
  - `src/state/gym-settings.ts` - Gym configuration

### Composables (Business Logic)
- `src/composables/useSchedule.ts` - Fetch/manage schedules
- `src/composables/useInstructorAssignment.ts` - AI assignment logic
- `src/composables/usePrivateLessons.ts` - Private lesson management
- `src/composables/useClassCancellation.ts` - Cancellation logic

### Supabase RPC Calls
All the database functions are ready:
- `assign_instructor_to_class()`
- `get_available_instructors()`
- `bulk_assign_instructor()`
- `cancel_class()`
- `get_affected_students()`
- `get_cancellation_alternatives()`
- `join_gym_as_instructor()`

---

## üéØ Next Immediate Steps

1. **Verify the migrations worked** - Run `VERIFY_MIGRATIONS_QUICK.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Start with Schedule Enhancement** - Most visible user-facing feature
3. **Test with existing user** - Join the second gym (Jiujitsio West) to test multi-gym

### Ready to Start?
Let me know which feature you'd like to tackle first, or if you'd like me to:
- A) Start with the combined schedule view (student-facing)
- B) Build the instructor preferences settings (instructor-facing)
- C) Create the AI-powered assignment tool (admin-facing)
- D) Something else?
