## Opening Lines (Memorize)

> "Hi, I'm presenting Ossome - an AI-powered team communication app built specifically for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym owners and their teams. The problem: Gym owners are drowning in messages across WhatsApp, text, and email - students asking about schedules, RSVPs, instructor assignments. My solution: A WhatsApp-inspired app with a gym-savvy AI assistant that handles scheduling queries, manages RSVPs, and proactively detects problems like missing instructors. Built with Quasar Vue 3, Supabase, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. Let's see it in action."

---

## Closing Lines (Memorize)

> "So that's Ossome - production-ready team communication for Jiu-Jitsu gyms. Real-time messaging with offline support, group chats, media sharing, and an AI assistant that actually understands gym operations. All 5 required technical capabilities implemented: RAG pipeline, user preferences, function calling with 12 tools, memory management, and error handling. Plus the advanced proactive scheduling capability. Built for the Remote Team Professional persona - gym owners coordinating trainers across locations. Thank you!"

## Technical Soundbites (If Asked)

**"Why not use ChatGPT?"**
> "ChatGPT doesn't know your gym's schedule or instructors. My AI has 12 custom tools integrated with the database - context-aware and action-oriented."

**"How does memory work?"**
> "The ai_conversations table stores full history. Every message passes the last 10 messages as context - that's the RAG pipeline."

**"What if AI makes a mistake?"**
> "Extensive error handling - UUID validation before tool calls, try/catch blocks throughout, user-friendly fallback messages."
