# AI-Powered Instructor Assignment - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1-6)

### Phase 1: Debug Empty Instructor List

**Created:**
- `diagnose_instructor_list.sql` - Comprehensive diagnostic queries to check gym members, roles, and instructor assignments

**Modified:**
- `src/composables/useInstructorAssignment.ts`
  - Added detailed console logging with emoji indicators
  - Added debug fallback to show all gym profiles when no instructors found
  - Expanded query to include `role` and `gym_id` fields for debugging

**Next Steps for Fixing:**
1. Run the diagnostic SQL: `pnpm db:apply diagnose_instructor_list.sql`
2. Check console logs when opening ClassDetailsDialog to see what data is returned
3. Verify users have correct `role` field set (`'instructor'` or `'owner'`)
4. Verify users have correct `gym_id` set to match the gym

### Phase 2: AI Tools for Instructor Management

**Added 7 New AI Tools to `useGymAI.ts`:**

1. **`get_instructors`** - List all instructors with their preferences
   - Optional: Include their current class schedule
   - Returns instructor profiles with roles and preferences

2. **`assign_instructor_to_class`** - Assign instructor to a class
   - Validates user is owner/admin
   - Supports one-time or recurring assignments
   - Uses existing `assign_instructor_to_class` database function

3. **`check_schedule_problems`** - Detect scheduling issues
   - Checks for missing instructors (critical if within 48h)
   - Checks for over-capacity classes
   - Checks for instructor conflicts (overlapping assignments)
   - Checks for cancelled classes with active RSVPs
   - Returns problems with severity and suggested actions

4. **`get_instructor_schedule`** - View an instructor's full schedule
   - Shows all classes they're teaching
   - Returns total class count

5. **`send_alert`** - Send notifications to gym members
   - Targets: gym_chat, instructors, or specific users
   - Posts formatted alert messages to chat

6. **`cancel_class_with_notification`** - Cancel class and notify members
   - Validates owner/admin permissions
   - Automatically notifies affected RSVP members
   - Posts cancellation notice to gym chat

### Phase 3: Update AI System Prompt

**Modified: `supabase/functions/gym-ai-assistant/index.ts`**

Added comprehensive instructor management section:
- Natural language examples for assignment
- Proactive problem detection guidelines
- Notification strategy (gym-wide vs instructor-specific)
- Severity levels (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO)

### Phase 4: Problem Detection Logic

**Created: `src/composables/useScheduleProblems.ts`**

Comprehensive problem detection system:

**Problem Types:**
- `no_instructor` - Classes without assigned instructors
  - **Critical** if within 48 hours
  - **Warning** if further out
- `over_capacity` - Classes exceeding max capacity
  - **Warning** severity
- `instructor_conflict` - Instructors assigned to overlapping classes
  - **Warning** severity
- `cancelled_with_rsvps` - Cancelled classes with active RSVPs
  - **Info** severity

**Features:**
- Checks date ranges (default: next 7 days)
- Provides specific suggested actions for each problem
- Detects time conflicts between classes
- Tracks occurrences of recurring classes

### Phase 5: Notification System Integration

**Implementation in `useGymAI.ts`:**

Notification system leverages existing chat infrastructure:
- **Gym-wide alerts**: Posts to `gym_chat_id`
- **Instructor alerts**: Currently uses gym_chat (future: dedicated instructor chat)
- **Class cancellations**: Auto-notifies RSVPed members

**Message Format:**
```
üö® Schedule Alert: [Problem Type]
Class: GI - Monday 7:00 PM
Issue: No instructor assigned
Action needed: Assign an instructor or cancel class
```

### Phase 6: Natural Language Examples

**Supported Commands:**

1. **List instructors**
   - "Who are the instructors?"
   - "Show me all instructors"
   - "List instructors with their schedules"

2. **Assign instructor**
   - "Assign John Silva to Monday 7pm GI class"
   - "Make Alex the instructor for Wednesday fundamentals"

3. **Check problems**
   - "Any problems with tomorrow's schedule?"
   - "Are there any classes without instructors?"
   - "Check for scheduling conflicts"

4. **View instructor schedule**
   - "What classes does John teach?"
   - "Show me Alex's schedule"

5. **Send alerts**
   - "Alert the gym about the class cancellation"
   - "Notify instructors about the schedule change"

6. **Cancel with notification**
   - "Cancel tomorrow's 6pm class, instructor is sick"
   - "Cancel Monday GI and notify everyone"

- [ ] Check database that assignment was saved
- [ ] Verify ClassDetailsDialog shows the instructor

#### Check Problems
- [ ] Create a test schedule without an instructor for tomorrow

### 3. Multi-Step Workflows

## üîß Configuration

### Owner/Admin Permissions

Most instructor management features require `role = 'owner'`. To grant permissions:

```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'owner'
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Instructor Permissions

To mark someone as an instructor:

```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'instructor'
WHERE email = 'instructor@example.com';
```

Or use the instructor QR code join flow.

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### For Gym Owners

1. **Morning Check**
   ```
   User: "Any problems with today's classes?"
   AI: [Checks schedule] ‚úÖ All classes have instructors assigned. No issues found.
   ```

2. **Quick Assignment**
   ```
   User: "Assign John Silva to Monday 7pm GI"
   AI: [Gets schedule] [Gets instructors] [Assigns] ‚úÖ Successfully assigned John Silva to GI - Monday 7:00 PM
   ```

3. **Handle Emergency**
   ```
   User: "No instructor for tonight's 6pm class. Should I cancel?"
   AI: [Checks problems] ‚ö†Ô∏è The 6pm NO-GI class has 12 confirmed RSVPs. 
        Options:
        1. Find a backup instructor
        2. Cancel and notify the 12 members
        What would you like to do?
   User: "Cancel it, instructor is sick"
   AI: [Cancels with notification] ‚úÖ Class cancelled. Notification sent to gym chat. 12 members affected.
   ```

4. **Prevent Conflicts**
   ```
   User: "Assign Alex Chen to Wednesday 7pm"
   AI: [Checks schedule] ‚ö†Ô∏è Alex Chen is already teaching Wednesday Fundamentals 6:30-7:30 PM, 
        which overlaps with this class. Would you like to:
        1. Assign a different instructor
        2. Adjust the class time
   ```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Smart Instructor Suggestions**
   - "Who should teach fundamentals?" ‚Üí AI analyzes preferences
   - Consider instructor experience, specialties, availability

2. **Automated Coverage Requests**
   - When instructor is missing, auto-post to instructor chat
   - "Need coverage for Monday 7pm GI - who's available?"

3. **Backup Instructor System**
   - Configure backup instructors for each class
   - Auto-assign backups when needed

4. **Scheduled Problem Checks**
   - Daily automated check at 6am
   - Proactive notifications for upcoming problems

5. **Instructor Dashboard**
   - Dedicated view for instructors to see their schedule
   - Mark availability, request time off

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No instructors available" in ClassDetailsDialog

1. Run diagnostic SQL: `pnpm db:apply diagnose_instructor_list.sql`
2. Check console logs for debug output
3. Verify users have `role IN ('instructor', 'owner')`
4. Verify users have correct `gym_id`

### AI doesn't assign instructors

1. Verify user is owner (not instructor or student)
2. Check console for tool execution logs
3. Verify `assign_instructor_to_class` database function exists
4. Check tool parameters are correct (valid UUIDs)

### Alerts not appearing in chat

1. Verify gym has `gym_chat_id` set
2. Check user permissions to post to chat
3. Verify chat exists and is active
4. Check browser console for errors

## üìû Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Run diagnostic SQL and share output
4. Test with simpler queries first ("Who are the instructors?")

**Status**: Implementation complete, testing required
**Next Steps**: 
1. Fix empty instructor list (run diagnostic SQL)
2. Test all natural language patterns
