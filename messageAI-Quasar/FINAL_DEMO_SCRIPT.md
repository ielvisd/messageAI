## 🎬 ONE-SHOT RECORDING SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:45 | OPENING: THE PROACTIVE DIFFERENCE

**[Screen: All 3 simulators visible, start on iPad]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Every AI gym assistant you'll see today works the same way: You ask a question, it answers. Reactive. But what if your AI didn't wait to be asked? What if it found problems before they became disasters? Watch this."

**ACTION:**
1. **Focus on iPad (Owner view)**
2. Show Instructor Dashboard with AI Insights Widget already visible
3. Widget shows proactive alerts:
   ```
   🚨 CRITICAL (1): Monday 7pm GI - No instructor assigned (in 24 hours)
   ⚠️ WARNING (2): Scheduling conflicts detected
   💡 INSIGHT: NO-GI classes trending 90% capacity - consider expansion
   ```

**NARRATION:**
> "Monday morning, Alex opens the app. Before she even asks, the AI has already scanned schedules, detected conflicts, analyzed capacity trends. It's already working. THIS is proactive AI. Now let me show you how it solves real problems."

---

### 0:45-2:00 | SCENARIO 1: STUDENT EMERGENCY + AI ASSISTANT

**[Transition: iPad → iPhone 2 (Student)]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Ana missed Monday's GI class. She needs the next one - fast."

**ACTION:**
1. **On iPhone 2**, tap AI Assistant icon (robot head in header)
2. Type: **"I missed Monday GI, when's the next one?"**
3. Watch AI respond in real-time with:
   - Schedule options with times, instructors, locations
   - Capacity info (e.g., "Wednesday 7pm GI with Carlos - 12/20 spots")
4. Student types: **"Sign me up for Wednesday 7pm"**
5. AI confirms RSVP: "✅ You're RSVPd for Wednesday 7pm GI with Carlos (13/20)"
6. **Immediately ask:** "Who's teaching?"
7. AI responds with instructor details and their bio

**NARRATION:**
> "Natural language. No menus. No scrolling through calendars. The AI understands context - it remembers she's looking at Wednesday's class. Function calling in action - 12 different tools, schedule lookup, RSVP management, all conversational. RAG pipeline retrieving relevant schedules. This is capability one and two."

---

### 2:00-3:30 | SCENARIO 2: INSTRUCTOR CRISIS + OFFLINE QUEUING

**[Transition: iPhone 2 → iPad (Owner)]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Remember that critical alert the AI found? Monday's GI class has no instructor, and 18 students already RSVPd. It's Sunday night. Let's fix this."

**ACTION:**
1. **On iPad**, tap AI Assistant icon
2. Type: **"Any problems with this week's schedule?"**
3. AI responds:
   ```
   🚨 CRITICAL: Monday 7pm GI - No instructor assigned
   📊 Current RSVPs: 18/20
   
   Available instructors Monday 7-9pm:
   • Ana Rodriguez (prefers NO-GI, available)
   • Carlos Martinez (assigned to South location)
   ```
4. Owner types: **"Assign Ana to Monday 7pm GI"**
5. AI executes assignment

**[NOW: Show offline queuing integrated]**

6. **Transition to iPhone 1 (Carlos)** - he needs to message the group
7. Carlos opens group chat "Monday GI Class"
8. **Toggle WiFi OFF** (Settings or simulator menu)
9. Type message: **"FYI - Ana is covering Monday class. She's great!"**
10. Hit send - message shows **"sending..."** with clock icon (optimistic UI)
11. **Switch to iPad and iPhone 2** - no message yet
12. **Toggle WiFi back ON on iPhone 1**
13. **Watch message sync instantly** across all devices
14. **Switch to iPhone 2** - push notification appears
15. **iPad also shows message** in real-time

**NARRATION:**
> "Problem solved in seconds. The AI didn't wait to be asked - it detected the conflict proactively. Memory and state management - it tracks the conversation flow. Error handling - watch what happens when Carlos loses WiFi. Messages queue offline, sync when connection returns. Graceful degradation. This is what production-ready looks like."

---

### 3:30-5:00 | SCENARIO 3: GYM-WIDE GROUP CHAT COORDINATION

**[Focus: Show all 3 devices, emphasize real-time sync]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Friday afternoon. Belt promotion ceremony tonight. The gym owner needs to coordinate with everyone - instructors, students, parents."

11. **Photo appears on all devices** with preview thumbnails

**NARRATION:**

**[Continue in same group chat]**

12. **Owner asks AI** (from within group chat or AI Assistant): **"Summarize this week's attendance"**
13. AI analyzes RSVP data and responds with insights:
    ```
    📊 This Week's Attendance:
    • GI Classes: 78 RSVPs across 6 sessions
    • NO-GI Classes: 92 RSVPs across 8 sessions
    • Open Mat: 45 RSVPs
    
    💡 Insight: NO-GI classes averaging 92% capacity
    Suggestion: Consider adding Thursday 8pm NO-GI session
    ```

**NARRATION:**
> "The AI isn't just managing schedules - it's analyzing patterns, suggesting growth opportunities. RAG pipeline pulling historical data. Function calling for analytics. User preferences understanding owner role permissions. This is all five AI capabilities working together."

### 5:00-6:00 | SCENARIO 4: INSTRUCTOR MANAGEMENT + VOICE COMMANDS

   • Wednesday 6pm - NO-GI (South)
   • Friday 7pm - Competition Training (North)
   
   Total hours: 6 | Classes: 3
   ```
8. **Again, tap microphone and speak:** "Can Ana teach Thursday 8pm NO-GI?"
9. AI checks and responds: **"Yes, Ana is available Thursday 8-10pm. Should I create the class and assign her?"**
10. **One more time, use voice:** "Yes, do it"
11. **Watch calendar update in real-time** - new class appears, Ana assigned
12. **Switch to iPhone 2 (Ana)** - push notification: "You've been assigned to Thursday 8pm NO-GI"

**NARRATION:**
> "Voice commands. Hands-free scheduling. Perfect for when you're on the mat demonstrating techniques or managing equipment. Instructor management. Schedule conflict detection. Automatic notifications. All controlled through natural language - typed OR spoken. The AI handles permissions - students can't assign instructors, but owners have full control. This is function calling with role validation."
