## 🎓 Demo Talking Points

### 1. Proactive AI (30 seconds)
> "Notice the AI widget auto-appeared. It's constantly monitoring the schedule every 5 minutes. If there's an issue, owners see it immediately - that's proactive vs reactive."

### 2. Voice Input (30 seconds)
> "Let me show you voice input - click mic, ask 'What classes need instructors?', and it auto-submits. This works on iOS Safari 14.5+, making the AI accessible hands-free during training."

### 3. Intelligent Dashboard (30 seconds)
> "The dashboard adapts to your role. Owners see stats with AI insights and trend analysis - these sparklines are pure Quasar, no Chart.js needed. Notice the insights change based on metrics."

### 4. iOS-First Design (20 seconds)
> "Everything is iOS-optimized: safe-area padding for the notch, 44pt touch targets per Apple HIG, and Quasar's QPageSticky for native positioning."

### 5. Architecture (20 seconds)
> "We unified 4 separate dashboards into one adaptive component - that's DRY code. The AI widget uses QPageSticky instead of custom CSS. All Quasar best practices."
