# AI Session Management - Smart Session Breaks

## What Was Implemented

We've implemented a lightweight "smart session break" system that allows the AI to start fresh conversations when users click on proactive alerts, while preserving all previous conversations in the database.

## How It Works

### 1. **Alert Click â†’ Fresh Session**
When a user clicks an action item from the AI Insights Widget:
- Sets `ai_start_fresh` flag in sessionStorage
- Navigates to AI Assistant page
- Clears the in-memory conversation (but DB record remains)
- Auto-sends contextual message about the specific problem

### 2. **Manual "Start New Conversation"**
When user clicks the refresh button in AI Assistant header:
- Clears `conversationId` to null (forces new DB record on next message)
- Clears in-memory messages **temporarily**
- Shows confirmation: "Conversation cleared. Refresh to restore, or start chatting fresh."
- **Does NOT persist** - page refresh will reload last conversation from DB
- Next message sent will create a new conversation in DB

### 3. **Conversation Preservation**
- Old conversations are **automatically saved** to `ai_conversations` table
- Each conversation has: `user_id`, `gym_id`, `messages`, `conversation_state`, `timestamps`
- Currently loads "most recent" conversation per user/gym
- All old conversations remain in DB for future retrieval

## Benefits

âœ… **No Database Changes** - Uses existing schema  
âœ… **Clean Context** - Alerts start focused conversations  
âœ… **Data Preserved** - All history stays in database  
âœ… **Simple UX** - Clear user feedback on what's happening  
âœ… **Flexible** - Easy to add session history UI later  

## User Experience

**Before:** Alert clicks added to ongoing conversation (context pollution)  
**After:** Alert clicks start fresh, focused conversation  

**Example Flow:**
1. User chats: "What classes are tomorrow?"
2. AI responds with schedule
3. User sees critical alert: "No instructor for Monday 7pm GI"
4. User clicks alert
5. ðŸ†• **NEW conversation starts** with focus on that specific problem
6. Old conversation about "tomorrow's classes" is saved but not lost

## Future Enhancement (Phase 2)

If users request it post-demo, can add:
- Conversation history dropdown
- Session titles (auto-generated from first message)
- `is_active` flag in database for better querying
- View/restore past conversations

## Files Modified

1. **AIInsightsWidget.vue** - Sets fresh session flag on alert click + forces navigation with query param
2. **AIAssistantPage.vue** - Detects flag and starts fresh conversation
3. **AIAssistantPage.vue** - Updated "Start New Conversation" button
4. **AIAssistantPage.vue** - Added route watcher to handle alerts when already on page
5. **useGymAI.ts** - Added `skipHistory` option to `initialize()` function
6. **useGymAI.ts** - Exported `conversationId` for session management

## Technical Implementation

### Handling "Already on Page" Scenario
When clicking an alert while already on `/ai-assistant`:
- Adds timestamp query param (`?t=timestamp`) to force route change
- Route watcher detects query change and re-runs session initialization
- Prevents need for manual page refresh

### "Start New Conversation" Behavior
When clicking "Start New Conversation":
1. Clears UI state only (temporary)
2. Page refresh will reload last conversation from DB
3. If user sends a message while cleared, that creates a new conversation
4. Gives users option to "undo" by refreshing, or commit to new conversation by chatting

**Why this approach?**
- Browser refresh (F5) = always restore last conversation (expected behavior)
- "Start New" button = temporary clear for fresh context
- Alert clicks = persistent new session (actual new conversation)

## Testing

To test the flow:
1. Start a conversation in AI Assistant
2. Ask a few questions (e.g., "Show me tomorrow's schedule")
3. Navigate to dashboard and expand AI widget
4. Click on any alert
5. âœ… Should see fresh conversation start with alert context
6. âœ… Old conversation still saved in database (check `ai_conversations` table)

## Database Query

To see all conversations for a user:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  messages->0->>'content' as first_message,
  jsonb_array_length(messages) as message_count
FROM ai_conversations
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

## Notes

- No breaking changes - existing conversations continue to work
- Backward compatible with current database schema
- Uses sessionStorage for cross-component communication
- Console logs added for debugging (`ðŸ†• Starting fresh AI conversation...`)
