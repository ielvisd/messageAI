## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd messageAI-Quasar
pnpm install
```

This will install the new `jsqr` package for QR scanning.

### Step 2: Apply Database Migrations

Run the automated migration script for each file:

```bash
# Migration 1: Create tables
bash scripts/apply-sql.sh supabase/migrations/20251025190000_attendance_tracking_system.sql

# Migration 2: Create functions
bash scripts/apply-sql.sh supabase/migrations/20251025190001_attendance_functions.sql
```

**Note**: Make sure `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is set in your environment or `.env` file.

### Step 3: Verify Database

Check that all tables and functions were created:

```sql
-- Tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('class_attendance', 'student_notes', 'belt_progression', 'class_qr_codes', 'instructor_evaluations');

-- Functions
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name LIKE '%attendance%' OR routine_name LIKE '%belt%';
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## üîß Integration Points

### Components that Need Integration

To complete the implementation, integrate these components into existing pages:

#### SchedulePage.vue (for instructors/owners)

Add a button to generate QR codes for each class:

```vue
<ClassQRCodeGenerator
  v-if="showQRGenerator"
  :schedule-id="selectedSchedule.id"
  :valid-date="new Date()"
  @close="showQRGenerator = false"
  @generated="onQRGenerated"
/>
```

Add a button to view/mark attendance:

```vue
<ManualAttendanceMarker
  v-if="showAttendanceMarker"
  :schedule-id="selectedSchedule.id"
  :gym-id="currentGymId"
  @close="showAttendanceMarker = false"
  @saved="onAttendanceSaved"
/>
```

#### Student Profile Views

Add actions for instructor notes and belt promotions:

```vue
<StudentNotesDialog
  v-model="showNotesDialog"
  :student-id="student.id"
  :student-name="student.name"
  :gym-id="currentGymId"
  @note-saved="refreshStudentData"
/>

<BeltPromotionDialog
  v-model="showPromotionDialog"
  :student-id="student.id"
  :student-name="student.name"
  :gym-id="currentGymId"
  @promoted="refreshStudentData"
/>
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Ensure HTTPS (camera requires secure context)
- Test on different browsers (Chrome/Safari recommended)

### QR Scanner Not Detecting

- Ensure good lighting
- Hold phone steady
- Try adjusting distance to QR code
- Check QR code hasn't expired

### Migrations Failing

- Verify SUPABASE_DB_URL is correct
- Check for existing table conflicts
- Run migrations in order (schema first, then functions)
