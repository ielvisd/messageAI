# Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Infinite Recursion in Profiles RLS - FIXED

**Problem:** Profiles table had RLS policies that queried the profiles table within their own USING clause, creating infinite loops.

**Solution:** Applied simple non-recursive RLS policies.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Should be working now (you applied the fix via Supabase SQL Editor)

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Demo Accounts & Young Kids - FIXED

**Problem 1:** Demo accounts were created with dummy password hashes that don't work for login.

**Problem 2:** Young kids (peewees, kids 8-12) were given accounts, but they shouldn't have their own accounts - they should be managed by parents.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Removed young kid accounts from login page (Lily, Mia)
2. ‚úÖ Updated demo account list to only show people who would have accounts (adults, older teens)
3. ‚úÖ Created proper instructions for creating demo accounts

**To Create Demo Accounts:**

### Quick Option (Create Just One for Testing)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zjqktoqpsaaigpaygtmm/auth/users
2. Click **"Add user"** ‚Üí **"Create new user"**
3. Email: `demo@test.com`
4. Password: `demo123456`
5. Click **"Create user"**
6. Run the SQL from `QUICK_CREATE_ONE_DEMO.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Full Option (Create All Demo Accounts)
Follow instructions in `CREATE_DEMO_ACCOUNTS_PROPERLY.md`

Create these 5 accounts via Supabase Dashboard:
- `alex.student@demo.com` - Adult, All Levels
- `jordan.competitor@demo.com` - Adult, Advanced, Both Gyms
- `sam.teen@demo.com` - Teen (15+)
- `parent.trainer@demo.com` - Parent Who Trains
- `casey.beginner@demo.com` - Adult Beginner
