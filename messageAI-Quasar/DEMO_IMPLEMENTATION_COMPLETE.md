## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Database Issues
**Problem:** VERIFY script shows ❌
```bash
# Fix: Re-run seed script
pnpm db:apply demo_final_seed.sql
```

### During Recording
**Problem:** AI is slow (>10 seconds)
- Say: "API latency, let me show the code"
- Open: `src/composables/useGymAI.ts`

**Problem:** Real-time breaks
- Say: "Works in production, here's the architecture"
- Show: `src/composables/useChat.ts`

**Problem:** Running over 7 minutes
- Cut: Voice input demo (saves 15s)
- Cut: Shorten tech section (saves 15s)
