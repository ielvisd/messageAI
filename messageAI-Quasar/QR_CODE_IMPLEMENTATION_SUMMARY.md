# QR Code Gym Join Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All components of the QR code gym join feature have been successfully implemented and tested for linting errors.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration: `20251025110000_add_qr_gym_join.sql`)
- Added `qr_token`, `require_approval`, and `gym_chat_id` columns to `gyms` table
- Created `gym_join_requests` table for tracking join requests requiring approval
- Added `owned_gym_ids` array column to `profiles` for multiple gym ownership
- Implemented RLS policies for secure access control
- Added triggers for auto-updating timestamps

### 2. Composables

#### `useGymQR.ts`
- `generateQRCodeURL()` - Generates QR code as data URL using qrcode library
- `getJoinURL()` - Gets the join URL for a gym
- `regenerateQRToken()` - Regenerates QR token (invalidates old codes)
- `joinGymViaQR()` - Handles student joining via QR code scan
- `getPendingRequests()` - Fetches pending join requests for owner
- `handleJoinRequest()` - Approves/rejects join requests
- `getGymByToken()` - Fetches gym info by QR token
- Automatically creates gym-wide chat when first student joins
- Adds students to gym chat upon joining

#### `useGymSwitcher.ts`
- `loadOwnedGyms()` - Loads all gyms owned by current user
- `switchGym()` - Switches active gym context
- `createNewGym()` - Creates new gym (owners can own multiple)
- `getGymDetails()` - Fetches detailed gym information

### 3. Pages

#### `GymJoinPage.vue` (NEW)
- Accessible at `/join/:token` (no auth required)
- Shows gym information from QR code
- Embedded signup/login form for unauthenticated users
- One-click join for authenticated users
- Handles both instant join and approval-required flows
- Responsive design with Quasar components

#### `OwnerDashboard.vue` (UPDATED)
- QR code display section with live QR code image
- Regenerate QR code button with confirmation dialog
- Download QR code as PNG
- Toggle for "Require admin approval for new members" (default: OFF)
- Pending join requests list (when approval is enabled)
- Approve/reject actions with avatars and timestamps
- Real-time request count badge

#### `AdminSettingsPage.vue` (UPDATED)
- Gym switcher section (shown when owner has multiple gyms)
- List of owned gyms with member/location counts
- Active gym badge indicator
- "Create New Gym" button and dialog
- Seamless gym switching with state reload

#### `GymSetupPage.vue` (UPDATED)
- Initializes `owned_gym_ids` array with first gym on creation

### 4. Router Updates
- Added `/join/:token` route using `AuthLayout` (public access)
- Route properly placed before authenticated routes

### 5. Dependencies
- Installed `qrcode` and `@types/qrcode` packages

## Key Features

### QR Code Flow
1. **Generation**: Owner sees QR code on dashboard automatically
2. **Scanning**: Student scans QR code with camera (redirects to `/join/:token`)
3. **Authentication**: Student signs up or logs in
4. **Joining**: Student joins gym (instant or pending approval)
5. **Chat Access**: Student auto-added to gym-wide chat group

### Multiple Gym Ownership
- Owners can create and manage multiple gyms
- Switch active gym context from Admin Settings
- Each gym has its own:
  - QR code
  - Members
  - Settings
  - Schedules
  - Chat groups

### Approval System
- **Default: OFF** - Students join instantly
- **When Enabled**: 
  - Join requests appear in Owner Dashboard
  - Owner can approve/reject with one click
  - Students see "pending approval" message
  - Notifications on approval/rejection

## Security Features
- Unique QR tokens per gym (UUID v4)
- QR codes can be regenerated to invalidate old ones
- RLS policies ensure only owners can:
  - View/update gym settings
  - Approve/reject join requests
  - Access other owner functions
- Students can only view their own join requests

## Auto-Created Resources
- **Gym-Wide Chat**: Created automatically when first student joins
- **Profile**: Auto-created on signup via trigger
- **QR Token**: Generated on gym creation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply migration: `supabase db push` or via SQL Editor
- [ ] Owner creates gym → QR code appears
- [ ] Download QR code works
- [ ] Regenerate QR code invalidates old one
- [ ] Scan QR code → redirects to join page
- [ ] Unauthenticated user → can sign up and join
- [ ] Authenticated user → can join instantly
- [ ] Toggle approval setting
