## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First-time Setup**: The migration creates profiles in the database, but you need to create the actual auth users via Supabase Auth or by having them sign up through the app first.

2. **Password**: All demo accounts use the same password: `demo123456`

3. **Data Persistence**: These are real database entries, so any changes made while logged in as a demo account will persist (messages sent, RSVPs, etc.)

4. **Testing Privacy**: Consider periodically resetting demo data if it gets cluttered from testing.

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove demo accounts and start fresh:

```sql
-- Remove from chat_members
DELETE FROM public.chat_members 
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email LIKE '%@demo.com'
);

-- Remove profiles
DELETE FROM public.profiles 
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email LIKE '%@demo.com'
);

-- Remove auth users
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email LIKE '%@demo.com';
```

Then re-run the migration to recreate them.
